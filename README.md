W.I. Construction website for senior capstone project

I created this website so that my dad could eventually further develop through a company to help increase the amount of customers 
he receives and to display the work that he has done to show the skills and quality of his work.

The website contains a Gallery page for users to view his work, a Contact page to reach out for a consultation, a Services page to see what services are
provided, and a About Us page to learn about the company. Also includes a login/logout and register form.

To run the project, download the code and run using Docker
All dependecies are listed in requirements.txt

The website uses Django for the web framework, Docker to manage the website, HTML, CSS, Java, and Bootstrap to stylize the website
